Easily promote pages in you sidebar and forget about not updated links.

== Description ==

Add a short teaser text with page thumbnail and link it to a page in your sidebar. The plugin takes care of correct linking. I am using the plugin on my own [website](http://www.jonaspiela.com/ "Jonas Piela").
